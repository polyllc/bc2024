- split up ducks into groups of the amount of flags that there are on the map
- when a duck is taking or near an enemy flag, notify all of the ducks by updating a index in the shared array saying the map location of where they are
- when the ducks spawn, assign them a group number related to their first spawn zone place
- once round hits a certain point, or if more than one flag is captured (and the enemy team has less flags captured), build traps around the flags in order to make sure the enemy doesn't get them

- New Streategy: have 5 or so ducks act as "alarms" that would use the code of detecting an enemy to their advantage. If they detect and enemy while they are at an important location(flag, chokepoint, etc) sends a global signal for a squadron of ducks to go there to stop the invasion
