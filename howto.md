# contribute
if you want to contribute, please assign yourself a task in the todo.md, commit and push to origin so we know who is doing what, or just tell us
then, create a new branch and call it by the task that you are doing, this allows you to make as many commits to the branch without having to always commit to main
then what you do is do your work, once it works, create a pull request where you want to merge your branch with the code in the main branch, to which i will review it, merge it, and delete the old branch
rinse and repeat
